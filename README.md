# Simple Web application

This repository contains a simple web application written in Python. The application uses Python with the Flask web framework to simplify the development. This code was built on a MacBook Pro running MacOS Ventura 13.6.6, Python 3.11.4, and the Flask web framework version 3.0.3. Your environment may differ and work fine with other versions; it is a simple application.

# To use the code

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Change the directory to the root of the clone.
3. Start the app:

   ```bash
   python app.py

The app starts a web server on the first open address and port, typically `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.  Paste this URL in your browser's address bar to view the app.
